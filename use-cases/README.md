# Use Cases Overview

Use case workflows built from the AI services in this repository live in this directory. Each use case demonstrates how multiple services can be composed to solve a specific problem.

| Use case directory | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **aps-summarization** | Processes an uploaded ZIP of Attending Physician Statements and generates summarized PDFs bundled in a new archive. |
| **legal-redaction** | Redacts subpoena PDFs using OCR, PII detection and PDF assembly. |

Additional use cases can be added following the same structure with their own `README.md` and deployment template.
