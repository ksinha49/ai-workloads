# Knowledge Base Service

This service provides simple endpoints to ingest text documents into the vector
database and query them using the retrieval stack. It relies on the existing
RAG ingestion and retrieval components. When ingesting documents you may include
 metadata fields such as department, team and user. These values are stored with
 each chunk and can be used to filter queries. When entity extraction is enabled
 during ingestion, the detected entities are indexed per chunk and can also be
 used as filters when querying.

## Lambdas and API Endpoints

- **ingest-lambda/app.py** – invoked manually or via an API to start the
  ingestion Step Function.
- **query-lambda/app.py** – `/kb/query` endpoint that publishes requests to the summarization queue.

## Parameters

- `IngestionStateMachineArn` – ARN of the ingestion workflow from the
  `rag-ingestion` stack.
- `SummarizeQueueUrl` – URL of the SQS queue consumed by the summarization worker from the `summarization` stack.
The query Lambda now publishes requests to this queue so processing happens asynchronously.
 - `KnowledgeBaseName` – optional name tag for the knowledge base.
 - Additional request fields include `department`, `team`, `user` and
   `entities`. These help isolate knowledge by organizational unit or only return
   chunks matching specific entities.
- Requests must include `collection_name` for the target Milvus collection. The `file_guid` generated by the summarization service propagates through the workflow so you can search by the original document.

### Required request fields

Both `/kb/ingest` and `/kb/query` must include a `collection_name` parameter so the service knows which Milvus collection to target. The `file_guid` output by the summarization workflow also propagates through ingestion and can be supplied to `/kb/query` to restrict results to a specific document. See the [summarization README](../summarization/README.md#file_guid) for additional context.

## Deployment

Deploy with SAM:

```bash
sam deploy \
  --template-file services/knowledge-base/template.yaml \
  --stack-name knowledge-base \
  --parameter-overrides \
    IngestionStateMachineArn=<arn> \
    SummarizeQueueUrl=<url>
```
